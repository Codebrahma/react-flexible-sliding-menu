# React Flexible Sliding Menu

A **React** library which provides **Flexible Sliding Menu** with an easy to use [API](https://react-flexible-sliding-menu.netlify.com/API/MenuProvider) and a bunch of other awesome [features](https://react-flexible-sliding-menu.netlify.com/#features). Also, you get to choose which [animation](https://react-flexible-sliding-menu.netlify.com/animations/slide) you want for the sliding menu.

> **Note:** The library is not restricted to just menus, technically you can provide any React Component to make it slide.

## Documentation ðŸ“–

Read the full Documentation [here](https://react-flexible-sliding-menu.netlify.com).

## Features

1. **Fully Flexible:** Pass whatever component you want, to make it slide and attach the triggers to whatever component you want.
2. **Conditionally Rendered:** Rather than hiding the menu (_setting `opacity:0`, or sending it off the viewport_), it is removed from the DOM itself.
3. **Fully Managed State:** Unlike most other libraries, state of Menu is managed by the library so that you don't have to.
4. **Uses React Context:** several methods are provided via context, so you can access it wherever you want in the component tree.

## Motivation

There are a lot of libraries out there which set out to do the same thing, some accomplished it some don't. But, I always found one or another thing missing in them. Hence, I built this library to fulfill my needs and possibly yours.
