# Usage with React Router

[React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) is routing library for React, which currently is the most popular routing library with 38.6K stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). We assume that you are already familier with React Router, if you are not here's a link to their [quick-start](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) guide.

For integrating your `MenuComponent` with React Router all you need to make sure is that `<MenuProvider/>` is present inside the `<BrowserRouter/>` and you can start using `<NavLink>` or `<Link>` inside your `MenuComponent`.

```
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import MenuProvider from 'react-flexible-sliding-menu';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import App from "./App";
import Menu from "./Menu";

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <MenuProvider MenuComponent={Menu} animation="push">
      <App />
    </MenuProvider>
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
