# React Flexible Sliding Menu

A **React** library which provides **Flexible Sliding Menu** with an easy to use [API](#) and a bunch of other awesome [features](/src-docs-introduction#features). Also, you get to choose which [animation](#) you want for the sliding menu.

> **Note:** The library is not restricted to just menus, technically you can provide any React Component to make it slide.

## Features

1. **Fully Flexible:** Pass whatever component you want, to make it slide and attach the triggers to whatever component you want.
2. **Conditionally Rendered:** Rather than hiding the menu (_setting `opacity:0`, or sending it off the viewport_), it is removed from the DOM itself.
3. **Fully Managed State:** Unlike most other libraries, state of Menu is managed by the library so that you don't have to.
4. **Uses React Context:** several methods are provided via context, so you can access it wherever you want in the component tree.

## Motivation

There are a lot of libraries out there which set out to do the same thing, some accomplished it some don't. But, I always found one or another thing missing in them. Hence, I built this library to fulfill my needs and possibly yours.

## Dependencies

Right now the only main Dependency is [Styled-Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), which I'll soon be replacing with vanilla css to reduce the library size even more.
